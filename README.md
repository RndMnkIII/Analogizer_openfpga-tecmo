# Analogizer openFPGA Tecmo core for Analogue Pocket

* [2.1] **Analogizer** support added by **RndMnkIII** and based on **nullobject** openfpga-tecmo Pocket port. See more in the Analogizer main repository: [Analogizer](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/Analogizer) [13/02/2025].

This Analogizer core use a configuration file to select Analogizer adapter options, not based on the Pocket's menu system. It is necessary to use [Pupdate](https://github.com/mattpannella/pupdate) release >= 4.3.1 or run an external [utility](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/AnalogizerConfigurator) to generate such a file. Once generated, you must copy the `analogizer.bin` file to the `/Assets/analogizer/common` folder on the Pocket SD card. If this folder does not exist, you must create it. Pupdate does all actions automatically after running this tool. Inside Pupdate navigate to: `Pocket Setup>Analogizer Config>Standard Analogizer Config`, choose Analogizer settings and exit to save to file.

The Analogizer interface allow to mix game inputs from compatible SNAC gamepads supported by Analogizer (DB15 Neogeo, NES, SNES, PCEngine, PSX) with Analogue Pocket built-in controls or from Dock USB or wireless supported controllers (Analogue support).

All Analogizer adapter versions (v1, v2 and v3) has a side slide switch labeled as 'A B' that must be configured based on the used SNAC game controller.
For example for use it with PSX Dual Shock or Dual Shock 2 native gamepad you must position the switch lever on the B side position. For the remaining
game controllers you must switch the lever on the A side position. 
Be careful when handling this switch. Use something with a thin, flat tip such as a precision screwdriver with a 2.0mm flat blade for example. Place the tip on the switch lever and press gently until it slides into the desired position:
```
     ---
   B|O  |A  A/B switch on position B
     ---   
     ---
   B|  O|A  A/B switch on position A
     ---
``` 

**Analogizer** is responsible for generating the correct encoded Y/C signals from RGB and outputs to R,G pins of VGA port. Also redirects the CSync to VGA HSync pin.
The required external Y/C adapter that connects to VGA port is responsible for output Svideo o composite video signal using his internal electronics. Oficially
only the Mike Simone Y/C adapters (active) designs will be supported by Analogizer and will be the ones to use.

Adapted to **Analogizer** by [@RndMnkIII](https://github.com/RndMnkIII).
Support native PCEngine/TurboGrafx-16 2btn, 6 btn gamepads and 5 player multitap using SNAC adapter
and PC Engine cable harness (specific for Analogizer). Many thanks to [Mike Simone](https://github.com/MikeS11/MiSTerFPGA_YC_Encoder) for his great Y/C Encoder project.

For output Scandoubler SVGA video you need to select in Pocket's Menu: `Analogizer Video Out > Scandoubler RGBHV`.

For output Y/C video you need to select in Pocket's Menu: `Analogizer Video Out > Y/C NTSC` or `Analogizer Video Out > Y/C NTSC,Pocket OFF`.

You will need to connect an active VGA to Y/C adapter to the VGA port (the 5V power is provided by VGA pin 9). I'll recomend one of these (active):
* [MiSTerAddons - Active Y/C Adapter](https://misteraddons.com/collections/parts/products/yc-active-encoder-board/)
* [MikeS11 Active VGA to Composite / S-Video](https://ultimatemister.com/product/mikes11-active-composite-svideo/)
* [Active VGA->Composite/S-Video adapter](https://antoniovillena.com/product/mikes1-vga-composite-adapter/)

Using another type of Y/C adapter not tested to be used with Analogizer will not receive official support.

I'll recomend also read this guide for MiSTer FPGA but can applied to Analogizer:
