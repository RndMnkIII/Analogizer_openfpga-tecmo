# Analogizer openFPGA Tecmo core for Analogue Pocket

* [2.1] **Analogizer** support added by **RndMnkIII** and based on **nullobject** openfpga-tecmo Pocket port. See more in the Analogizer main repository: [Analogizer](https://github.com/RndMnkIII/Analogizer) [10/01/2025].

The Analogizer interface allow to mix game inputs from compatible SNAC gamepads supported by Analogizer (DB15 Neogeo, NES, SNES, PCEngine, PSX) with Analogue Pocket built-in controls or from Dock USB or wireless supported controllers (Analogue support).

All Analogizer adapter versions (v1, v2 and v3) has a side slide switch labeled as 'A B' that must be configured based on the used SNAC game controller.
For example for use it with PSX Dual Shock or Dual Shock 2 native gamepad you must position the switch lever on the B side position. For the remaining
game controllers you must switch the lever on the A side position. 
Be careful when handling this switch. Use something with a thin, flat tip such as a precision screwdriver with a 2.0mm flat blade for example. Place the tip on the switch lever and press gently until it slides into the desired position:
```
     ---
   B|O  |A  A/B switch on position B
     ---   
     ---
   B|  O|A  A/B switch on position A
     ---
``` 

The following options exist in the core menu to configure Analogizer:
* **SNAC Adapter** List: None, DB15,NES,SNES,PCE,PCE Multitap, SNES swap A,B<->X,Y buttons, PSX (Digital DPAD), PSX (Analog DPAD), PSX (P1 Lightgun). The Lightgun option uses PSX Analogic stick as SNES Lightgun aiming track.
* **SNAC Controller Assignment** List: several options about how to map SNAC controller to Pocket controls. The controls not mapped to SNAC by default will map to Pocket connected controllers (Pocket built-in or Dock).
* **Analogizer Video Out** List: you can choose between RGBS (VGA to SCART), RGsB (works is a PVM as YPbPr but using RGB color space), YPbPr (for TV with component video input),
Y/C NTSC or PAL (for SVideo o compositive video using Y/C Active adapter by Mike S11).

**Analogizer** is responsible for generating the correct encoded Y/C signals from RGB and outputs to R,G pins of VGA port. Also redirects the CSync to VGA HSync pin.
The required external Y/C adapter that connects to VGA port is responsible for output Svideo o composite video signal using his internal electronics. Oficially
only the Mike Simone Y/C adapters (active) designs will be supported by Analogizer and will be the ones to use.

Adapted to **Analogizer** by [@RndMnkIII](https://github.com/RndMnkIII).
Support native PCEngine/TurboGrafx-16 2btn, 6 btn gamepads and 5 player multitap using SNAC adapter
and PC Engine cable harness (specific for Analogizer). Many thanks to [Mike Simone](https://github.com/MikeS11/MiSTerFPGA_YC_Encoder) for his great Y/C Encoder project.

For output Scandoubler SVGA video you need to select in Pocket's Menu: `Analogizer Video Out > Scandoubler RGBHV`.

For output Y/C video you need to select in Pocket's Menu: `Analogizer Video Out > Y/C NTSC` or `Analogizer Video Out > Y/C NTSC,Pocket OFF`.

You will need to connect an active VGA to Y/C adapter to the VGA port (the 5V power is provided by VGA pin 9). I'll recomend one of these (active):
* [MiSTerAddons - Active Y/C Adapter](https://misteraddons.com/collections/parts/products/yc-active-encoder-board/)
* [MikeS11 Active VGA to Composite / S-Video](https://ultimatemister.com/product/mikes11-active-composite-svideo/)
* [Active VGA->Composite/S-Video adapter](https://antoniovillena.com/product/mikes1-vga-composite-adapter/)

Using another type of Y/C adapter not tested to be used with Analogizer will not receive official support.

I'll recomend also read this guide for MiSTer FPGA but can applied to Analogizer:
